- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sbf5calvin. My name's Sam Fynewever! I'm a student at Calvin University. 
Some proof I exist: https://worship.calvin.edu/resources/resource-library/strong-in-joy - this is a service the Gospel Choir & Worship Apprentices at Calvin put together. Watch me read scripture!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in secondary education, particularly in mathematics and Spanish (these are my majors), as well as music. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Git and RStudio as part of a summer research project with Prof. DeRuiter (@stacyderuiter) at Calvin. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at sbf5@students.calvin.edu.
